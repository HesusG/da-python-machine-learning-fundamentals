# da-python-machine-learning-fundamentals


## :wave: Welcome

This project is a repository for Python machine learning fundamentals, containing a variety of Jupyter notebooks that cover different aspects of machine learning. The notebooks include topics such as linear and polynomial regression, autoregressive models, classification, dimensionality reduction, clustering and ensemble models. ## ðŸ’» Description

The project begins by importing and cleaning the dataset, including tasks such as handling missing values and converting data types. Next, the project explores the dataset through various visualization methods, such as creating bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to gain insights into the data. Finally, the project connects to a MySQL database using dbplyr, allowing for more advanced analysis and manipulation of the data. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and can serve as a foundation for further analysis.
